# Research Question

If you see someone else yawn, are you more likely to yawn?

In an episode of the show **Mythbusters**, they tested the myth that yawning is contagious. 

---

# Participants and Procedure

--

- `\(N = 50\)` adults who thought they were being considered for an appearance on the show. 

--

- Each participant was interviewed individually by a show recruiter ("confederate") who either
    - yawned, `\(n = 34\)`
    - or not, `\(n = 16\)`. 

--

- Participants then sat by themselves in a large van and were asked to wait. 

--

- While in the van for some set amount of time (unknown), the Mythbusters watched to see if the unaware participants yawned.



---

# Data

Two group design: 

- `\(n = 34\)` saw the confederate yawn (*seed*)
- `\(n = 16\)` did not see the confederate yawn (*control*)

--


```r
group &lt;- c(rep("control", 12), rep("seed", 24), 
            rep("control", 4), rep("seed", 10))
yawn &lt;- c(rep(0, 36), rep(1, 14))

yawn_myth &lt;- data_frame(subj = seq(1, 50), group, yawn) %&gt;% 
  mutate(yawn = as.factor(yawn))

glimpse(yawn_myth)
```

```

## Conclusion

## *Finding: CONFIRMED*&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;

# Really?

&gt; "Though that's not an enormous increase, since they tested 50 people in the field, the gap was still wide enough for the MythBusters to confirm that yawning is indeed contagious."&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;

.footnote[

# State the hypotheses

--

`\(H_0\)`:  

&gt; There is no difference between the seed and control groups in the proportion of people who yawned.

--

`\(H_1\)` (directional): 

&gt; More people (relatively) yawned in the seed group than in the control group.

---

# Test the hypothesis

Which type of hypothesis test would you conduct here?

- Independent samples t-test
- Two proportion test
- Chi-square test of independence
- Analysis of Variance
- I don't know!

## Is this difference *meaningful*?

## Different question:

## Is this difference *significant*?

# Modeling the null hypothesis

If... 

`$$H_0: p_{seed} = p_{control}$$`

is true, then whether or not the participant saw someone else yawn does not matter: there is no association between exposure and yawning.

## The parallel universe distribution

![](inference_slides_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;


The distribution of 1000 differences in proportions, if the null hypothesis were *true* and yawning was not contagious. 

In how many of our "parallel universes" is the difference as big or bigger than the one we observed (0.0441176)?


---
## Calculating the p-value

![](inference_slides_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-13-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;

That proportion is the p-value!


```
# A tibble: 1 x 3
  n_as_big n_total p_value
     &lt;int&gt;   &lt;int&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;
1      512    1000   0.512

# `infer`

5 functions:

- `specify()`
- `hypothesize()`
- `generate()`
- `calculate()`
- `visualize()`

---

# `infer`

- `specify` the response and explanatory variables (`y ~ x`)
- `hypothesize` what the null `\(H_0\)` is (here, `independence` of `y` and `x`)
- `generate` new samples from parallel universes:
    - Resample from our original data **without replacement**, each time shuffling the `group` (`type = "permute"`)
    - Do this **a ton of times** (`reps = 1000`)
- `calculate` the *new* statistic (`stat = "diff in props"`) for each `rep`



```r
set.seed(8)
null_distn &lt;- yawn_myth %&gt;% 
  specify(formula = yawn ~ group, success = "1") %&gt;% 
  hypothesize(null = "independence") %&gt;% 
  generate(reps = 1000, type = "permute") %&gt;% 
  calculate(stat = "diff in props", order = c("seed", "control"))
```

---

# Visualize the null distribution

- `visualize` the distribution of the `stat` (here, `diff in props`)

![](inference_slides_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-16-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;



```r
visualize(null_distn, bins = 10) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = obs_diff, 
             color = "dodgerblue",
             size = 2) 
```



---

# Classical inference

Rely on theory to tell us what the null distribution looks like.




```r
yawn_myth %&gt;%
  specify(yawn ~ group, success = "1") %&gt;%
  hypothesize(null = "independence") %&gt;% 
  # generate() is not needed since we are not doing randomization
  # calculate(stat = "z") is implied based on variable types
  visualize(method = "theoretical") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = obs_stat, color = "orchid", size = 2) 
```

![](inference_slides_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-19-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;



---
# Classical vs resampling

Changed the `stat` to calculate to `z` now (before we did `diff in props`).  


```r
yawn_myth %&gt;%
  specify(yawn ~ group, success = "1") %&gt;%
  hypothesize(null = "independence") %&gt;% 
  generate(reps = 1000, type = "permute") %&gt;% 
  calculate(stat = "z", order = c("seed", "control")) %&gt;% 
  visualize(method = "both", bins = 10) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = obs_stat, color = "orchid", size = 2)  
```

![](inference_slides_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-20-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;

---

# Do the test in R


```r
yawn_table &lt;- table(group, yawn)
yz &lt;- prop.test(x = yawn_table, n = nrow(yawn_myth),
          alternative = "greater", correct = FALSE) 
yz
```

```

	2-sample test for equality of proportions without continuity
	correction

data:  yawn_table
X-squared = 0.10504, df = 1, p-value = 0.3729
alternative hypothesis: greater
95 percent confidence interval:
 -0.1754872  1.0000000
sample estimates:
   prop 1    prop 2 
0.7500000 0.7058824 
```

--

What does this test assume?

---

# Pull out the z statistic

The observed `z` value is 0.105042. 


```r
obs_stat &lt;- yz %&gt;% 
  broom::tidy(yz) %&gt;% 
  pull(statistic)
```

Now you can use `obs_stat` in `geom_vline(xintercept = obs_stat)` when added to `visualize`!

---

# In class exercise

- Read in the `mazes` data (http://bit.ly/mazes-gist)


```r
library(readr)
mazes &lt;- read_csv("http://bit.ly/mazes-gist") %&gt;% 
  clean_names() #janitor package
```


- Use `dplyr::filter` to include only two groups (`DX` if you didn't `clean_names()`; `dx` if you did!).

- Use `infer` to compare a numerical variable between the two groups using:
    - A permutation test and
    - A classical theoretical test.
